# 🔐 Auth Made Awesome

😤 "Your session has expired. Please log in again."

*Screams internally while retyping everything*

The authentication struggle is real! But **creating login systems** doesn't have to make you pull your hair out.

Hey there, fellow coders! Sick of spending countless hours creating yet another login form when you could be building the ***actual cool stuff*** in your app? 

I've been there too... staring at the screen at 2 AM wondering why OAuth flows hate me personally.

## Well, I gotcha covered! 👊

This repo contains different implementations of authentication systems in various tech stacks, so you can pick whatever suits your project best. 

No more reinventing the wheel or getting stuck in authentication hell!

## 🚀 Available Implementations
